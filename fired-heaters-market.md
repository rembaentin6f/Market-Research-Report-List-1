<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fired Heaters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Fired Heaters</li><li>Indirect Fired Heaters</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The fired heaters market is primarily divided into two types: direct fired heaters and indirect fired heaters. Direct fired heaters utilize combustion inside the heater to directly heat the process fluid or air, providing rapid temperature increases but with potential combustion products entering the heated space. In contrast, indirect fired heaters heat the fluid or air indirectly through a heat exchanger, ensuring no combustion gases mix with the heated medium, making them suitable for applications requiring high purity and safety.</p></p>
