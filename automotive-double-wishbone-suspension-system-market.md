<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Double Wishbone Suspension System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-independent Suspension</li><li>Independent Suspension</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive double wishbone suspension system can be categorized into two main types: non-independent suspension and independent suspension. Non-independent suspension connects both wheels on an axle, meaning movement in one affects the other, resulting in less individual wheel control. Conversely, independent suspension allows each wheel to move independently, enhancing ride comfort and handling by minimizing body roll and improving traction. This distinction influences vehicle performance, with independent systems generally preferred for higher-end models due to their superior dynamics.</p></p>
