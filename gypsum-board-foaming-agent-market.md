<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gypsum Board Foaming Agent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Stable Foaming Agents</li><li>Unstable Foaming Agents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The gypsum board foaming agent market is segmented into two main types: stable and unstable foaming agents. Stable foaming agents create a consistent foam that retains its structure during the gypsum board manufacturing process, enhancing features like insulation and fire resistance. In contrast, unstable foaming agents produce foam that dissipates quickly, leading to lighter boards but with less durability. Both types serve unique functions, catering to different manufacturing requirements and product specifications within the construction industry.</p></p>
