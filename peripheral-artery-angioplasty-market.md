<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Peripheral Artery Angioplasty Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Balloon Angioplasty</li><li>Stent Implantation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Peripheral Artery Angioplasty market primarily consists of two types: Balloon Angioplasty and Stent Implantation. Balloon Angioplasty involves using a catheter with a deflated balloon that is inflated at the site of narrowed arteries to restore blood flow. Stent Implantation, on the other hand, involves placing a small mesh tube to keep the artery open after balloon inflation, providing long-term support and reducing the likelihood of re-narrowing. Both procedures address peripheral artery disease effectively, enhancing patient outcomes.</p></p>
